Contributing to Simple PHP Project
==================================

This project is meant to act as a practice project for Seattle PHP User Group
members, so we only want contributions from members of the group.

To setup the project:

1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. Run `make setup` (Linux and Mac). This will download some additional tools
   and install dependencies via Composer.

To contribute:

1. Make changes and submit a pull request (PR). Make sure to include tests, if
   necessary. Please reference any relevant issues in your commit message.
2. Your PR will be reviewed, and if everything looks good and the Travis CI
   build passes, we will merge the PR. If it needs more work, we'll let you
   know.

Thanks for your contributions!
